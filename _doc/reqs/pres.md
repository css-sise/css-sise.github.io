title: Topic presentation (22%)
---

Each week one or more groups of students will be in charge of leading the discussion of a topic. The additional readings listed under the [Schedule](/schedule.html) for that week will provide the necessary materials for you to cover during class. Your grade will be based on the **clarity and depth of knowledge** you exhibit while presenting the topic to the class as well as **your ability to engage the other students** in discussion. You will have no more than 50 minutes at your disposal, and you are encouraged to use this time in the most creative and educating manner you see fit. Assignment to groups and topics will be conducted after the first class.
