title: Project (50%)
---

Students need to take on **individual projects**, ideally ones that excite and challenge them, and contribute to their master thesis. The project needs to formulate and properly support one computational social science research question (or specific hypothesis), collect data that demonstrates the ability to answer that question, outline methodology for answering it, and define a metric for success. Notice that you are not required to answer the actual research question, nor are you required to provide any preliminary results (even though that would earn you extra points). The focus is solely on your ability to substantiate a research question in CSS and demonstrate the viability of answering it with data and computational tools in a reasonable manner. 

**Proposal**: On week #5, you will have to deliver a 5-minutes pitch of your project. Make sure that your pitch describes the importance of the problem you'd like to tackle, its potential contribution/s, three or more lines of related work, and the data and methodology that will be needed for answering it. Your peers will rank the proposals (anonymously), and the top ranked proposals will earn 1, 2, or 3 points in the final grade. Other than that, proposals will not be graded.

**Final presentation (20%)**: 15-20 minutes presentation, delivered on week #12 or #13. 

**Report (30%)**: Up to 4 pages (excluding references) following the [ACM guidelines and template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-master-template/pnrfvrrdbfwt) and submitted as a pdf via <a href="mailto:nirxgrn@bxgu.ac.il?subject=SISE.5351 Final report: [Your full name here] [Your ID here]" onmouseover="this.href=this.href.replace(/x/g,'');">email to the class instrcutor with the subject "SISE.5351 Final report: [Your full name here] [Your ID here]"</a>. **Submission is due by Friday of week #13**.
