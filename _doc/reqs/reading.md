title: Reading responses and peer reviews (18%)
---

The required readings for each class are listed under the [Schedule](/schedule.html) page. You will need to submit on Moodle reading responses, in English, prior to each class (roughly 1-2 pages). **Responses are due at midnight before each class**. **A week after each class you are required to complete peer review** of a few of your classmates responses, including (constructive) feedback and a grade. The class instructor will participate in grading as well as auditing the peer review process. 

Unless specified otherwise on the response task in Moodle, you are asked to answer three questions about the assigned reading:
- What are the main contributions?
- What are the major weakness, and how could they be improved?
- What are some of the promising research questions, and how could they be pursued?

The guidelines for peer grading are as follows:

- 90-100 Student provided a truly exceptional response that thoroughly covered all the required points and went above and beyond the requirement. This includes, but not limited to, reading additional papers, reflecting on the the issues at hand in-depth, providing thought-provoking comments, and writing in a clear and eloquent manner. 
- 80-89 Student provided high-quality response that covered all of the main points. 
- 65-79 Student provided a response that covers some of the main points but not all, reflecting partial understanding of the readings, writing insufficiently short response, or providing low quality text. 
- 0-64 Student did not submit a response, provided extremely short response, covered only 1-2 of the main issues, did not understand key points.
