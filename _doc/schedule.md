#### Schedule is subject to change

I reserve the right to introduce changes in the schedule for various reasons, including to accomodate your feedback about the class, my sense of the group's progress, externally imposed constraints (e.g. another lockdown), or to include more recent contributions. No schedule change will be introduced without prior notice of at least two weeks.

#### Reading responses &amp; peer reviews

- Reading responses are due at midnight before each class (submit on Moodle). 
- Peer reviews are due on Tue the week after class that discussed that topic (also on Moodle).
